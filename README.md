# EtchASketch

## Instructions:
1. Open [Etch-A-Sketch](https://etch-a-sketch-by-eleni.netlify.app/)
2. Hover your mouse around the grid to make cool patterns
3. Refresh the page to clear the grid
4. Click the "How many squares?" button to change the size of the grid


### What I have used:
- HTML
- CSS
- Inline JavaScript

### What I have learned:
- CSS selector specificity
- Using advanced CSS selectors, such as sibling combinators
- Targetting elements using "getElementBy..."
- Creating functions to create and resize the grid
- Adding event listeners to change the colour of the cells
- Difference between prompts and alerts
- Using "onclick" to call a function


### Improvements to be made:
- Altering the size of the grid outline after user inputs a new number
- Clear grid after user inputs a new number
